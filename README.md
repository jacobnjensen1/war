# war
My first real Python, Bash, and R projects. They aren't very clean, but they do what's needed.
This project is just for fun. It started as a challenge loosely given by a professor, but mostly from myself.
This works by running the testWar.bash file. It will run war.py 2000 times, each time appending the current proportion
of wins for each player (one and two) to warTrends.csv. After this file is populated, plotTrends.R makes a plot
showing the proportion of wins that each player had over time.
